awk
    process and manipulate data and produce formatted reports

Remove duplicate entries in a file without sorting.
    awk '!x[$0]++' <file>

   - Finds duplicates in a file without soring, which reorders the contents
   - awk will not reorder the content, and still finds and removes duplicates which can be redirected into another file
