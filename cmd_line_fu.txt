cat /dev/urandom | hexdump -C | grep "ca fe"
    looks cool.
    great way to pretending to look busy 
    I hope I can get a job where I can do this. Drink coffee and run this.

watch -n 1 "netstat -tpanl | grep ESTABLISHED"
    monitor TCP opened connections

awk "NR==4" 
sed -n '4p' 
sed '4!d'
    print just line 4 from a textfile
    append a file name after.

history | awk '{a[$2]++}END{for(i in a){print a[i] " " i}}' | sort -rn | head
    this will list commands that you use often

!!
    repeats last command

!n
    repeats the nth command on the history 
    really useful if the level is too deep, and you do not want to retype
    
nmap -sP 192.168.1.100-254
    pinging a range of ip addresses.
    i know fping works too but nmap just has so much options.

ping xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx size 1024 repeat 100
    ping a certain address with size of 1024 bytes 100 times.

ping -b 192.168.0.255
    ping all hosts on 192.168.1.0/24
    this command makes connections of what we learned.
